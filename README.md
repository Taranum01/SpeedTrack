# SpeedTrack

This performance monitor application provides real-time information about the performance of the user's computer. 

It uses psutil to gather information about system resources such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, and network usage. 
The speedtest library is used to measure the internet speed of the user's network.
The application has graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter, which displays the performance data in an easy-to-read format.
